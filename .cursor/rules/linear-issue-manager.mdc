# Linear Issue Manager

## Configuration Dependencies

**Required Files:**
- `.cursor/project.json` - Project configuration
- `.cursor/learning-patterns.json` - Learning data

**Auto-Creation Logic:**
If either file missing, prompt Project Manager to create them first:
```
⚠️ Configuration missing! 
Run Project Manager setup first:
Type: "setup project"
```

## Ticket Detection System

**Auto-Triggers:**
- Direct ID: `K0D-123`, `PROJ-456`
- Contextual: "work on 123", "implement K0D-456"
- Batch: "K0D-123,124,125"

**Pre-Analysis Validation:**
```
🔍 System Check:
✅ Project config loaded
✅ Learning system active  
✅ Linear API connected
🚀 Ready for ticket analysis!
```

## Smart Action Plan Generation

**Learning-Enhanced Analysis:**
Read learning patterns to customize approach based on:
- Historical approval rates for similar tickets
- User's preferred implementation strategies
- Past estimation accuracy for ticket types
- Quality standards and risk tolerance

**Action Plan Template:**
```
# 🚀 K0D-123: [Ticket Title]
**Type:** Feature | **Priority:** High | **Est:** 6-8h | **Confidence:** 85%

## Learning Insights
📊 **Pattern Match**: Similar auth tickets averaged 7.2 hours
🎯 **Your Style**: You typically approve these with security-first approach
⚡ **Approach**: Based on 12 similar tickets you've completed

## System Status
✅ **Config**: .cursor/project.json loaded
✅ **Learning**: 15 tickets analyzed, strong patterns
✅ **Linear**: Connected to K0D team

## Required Changes
**Files to Modify:** (Ordered by your familiarity)
- `/src/auth/LoginForm.tsx` - High familiarity (worked 8x)
- `/api/auth/verify.ts` - New territory, extra time allocated  
- `/types/user.ts` - Quick change, follows your patterns

## Implementation Strategy
**Phase 1:** Database Setup (2h) - Your preferred starting point
**Phase 2:** API Implementation (3h) - Matches your avg API time
**Phase 3:** Frontend Integration (2h) - Based on React expertise
**Phase 4:** Testing & QA (1h) - Adjusted for your coverage standards

## Risk Assessment
**Level:** Medium
**Concerns:** 
- Auth system changes (you flagged similar as medium-risk)
- Database migration required (add 30min based on past)
- Integration testing needed (your quality standard)

## Definition of Done
Based on your project quality settings:
- [ ] Code implemented with 80%+ test coverage
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Security review completed (your auth preference)
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met

## Approval Required
✅ **APPROVE** - Proceed with this plan
📝 **MODIFY** - Suggest changes (teaches preferences)
⏭️ **QUICK** - Skip detailed analysis next time
❌ **REJECT** - Cancel this approach

**Ready to implement?**
```

## Codebase Analysis Engine

**Intelligent File Detection:**
- Scan imports and dependencies
- Identify component relationships
- Map data flow and state changes  
- Detect architectural patterns
- Estimate change complexity

**Learning-Enhanced Analysis:**
- Prioritize files user has experience with
- Apply successful patterns from past work
- Flag approaches that previously caused issues
- Adjust estimates based on user's historical performance

## Implementation Workflow

**After Approval:**
1. Create feature branch: `{branchPrefix}/K0D-123-description`
2. Update Linear ticket status to "In Progress"
3. Implement changes with progress updates
4. Run tests and validation
5. Update ticket with completion status
6. Log outcomes to learning system

**Progress Reporting:**
- "✅ Phase 1 complete: Database schema updated (2.1h actual vs 2h estimated)"
- "🔄 Phase 2 in progress: API endpoints implementation (60% done)"
- "⚠️ Issue detected: Missing dependency, adding 30min to estimate"

## Learning System Integration

**Data Collection:**
Every interaction records:
- Ticket type and complexity assessment
- User approval/rejection decision and reasoning
- Estimated vs actual implementation time
- Quality outcomes and issues encountered
- User satisfaction and feedback patterns

**Pattern Recognition:**
- Track approval predictors by ticket characteristics
- Learn optimal implementation sequences
- Identify user's quality priorities and risk tolerance
- Recognize most effective communication styles

**Adaptive Behavior:**
- Increase confidence for high-approval patterns
- Reduce detail for trusted ticket types
- Adjust estimates based on accuracy history
- Personalize risk warnings and suggestions

## Cross-Rule Learning Exchange

**Receive from Project Manager:**
- Current project priorities and context
- Team velocity and capacity data
- Quality standards and milestone pressures
- Historical project patterns and insights

**Provide to Project Manager:**
- Implementation progress and velocity data
- Technical risks and architectural insights
- Resource utilization and capacity feedback
- Quality metrics and testing outcomes

## Error Recovery & Fallbacks

**Configuration Missing:**
```
❌ Setup required!
Missing: .cursor/project.json

Please run: "setup project"
Cannot proceed with ticket analysis until configured.
```

**Learning Data Corruption:**
```
⚠️ Learning data corrupted, reinitializing...
📝 Creating fresh learning patterns
🧠 Will start learning from your new interactions
```

**Linear API Failure:**
```
❌ Linear API unavailable
🔄 Using offline analysis mode
📋 Generating plan based on codebase analysis only
⚡ Will sync with Linear when connection restored
```

## Advanced Features

**Smart Questions:**
Based on learned patterns, ask contextual questions:
- "Your auth changes typically need security review - schedule now?"
- "Past similar tickets required performance testing - include benchmarks?"
- "You usually batch database changes - combine with K0D-145?"

**Workflow Optimization:**
- Suggest optimal work sequences based on past success
- Remember preferred debugging approaches
- Learn effective testing strategies for different scenarios
- Adapt to user's most productive coding patterns

**Quality Integration:**
- Apply project's Definition of Done automatically
- Adjust quality gates based on ticket criticality
- Learn user's quality preferences and emphasize accordingly
- Track quality outcomes to improve future suggestions

Always require explicit approval before implementing changes - maintain user control while providing intelligent assistance.
