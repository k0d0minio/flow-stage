# AI-Assisted Development Pipeline Documentation

## Overview

This documentation provides comprehensive guidance for implementing the AI-assisted development pipeline that achieves **5x revenue efficiency** compared to traditional development approaches. The system combines strategic ticket management, intelligent error recovery, MVP-first methodologies, and quality enforcement to enable **90-95% code automation** while maintaining production-quality standards.

## Core Components

### 1. Strategic Two-Phase Ticket Management

**Phase 1: Rapid Requirements Capture**
- Preserves raw customer context verbatim
- Uses confidence scoring (0.4-0.6 threshold) for automatic routing
- Routes uncertain requirements (<0.6 confidence) to human review
- Processes clear items autonomously
- Stores unprocessed documents alongside AI-generated summaries

**Phase 2: Deep Analysis and Implementation**
- Leverages full context windows for detailed user story generation
- Generates acceptance criteria with MVP focus
- Identifies technical dependencies and blockers
- Creates implementation task breakdown
- Links related issues and PRs automatically

### 2. OODA Loop Error Recovery

**Observe-Orient-Decide-Act Framework:**
- **Observe**: Monitor task execution and identify failure points
- **Orient**: Analyze failure context and determine recovery strategy
- **Decide**: Choose appropriate fallback mechanism
- **Act**: Execute recovery with automatic cleanup

**Key Features:**
- Hard stops after 3 failed attempts
- Automatic cleanup mechanisms
- Checkpoint-and-rollback systems
- Graduated retry logic with exponential backoff

### 3. MVP-First Development Strategy

**Dynamic MVP Classification:**
- Parses customer documents using multi-engine processing
- Combines GPT-4 for natural language understanding
- Uses specialized OCR engines for structured documents
- Automatically classifies features as core MVP vs. nice-to-have
- Applies RICE method with automated complexity scoring

**5-Step MVP Process:**
1. Problem Validation with AI-powered market research
2. Visual Mockups using v0.dev integration
3. Core Feature Definition with automated complexity scoring
4. AI-Assisted Build leveraging Cursor's context optimization
5. Iterate Based on Feedback through structured user loops

### 4. Quality Enforcement

**Automated Test Generation:**
- Generate comprehensive Jest test suites for all new code
- Use ESLint for code quality and consistency validation
- Achieve 85% reduction in test development time through AI assistance
- Maintain 90%+ test coverage across all components

**Quality Gates:**
- 90%+ test coverage across all code
- ESLint compliance with zero warnings
- Jest test suite passes for all functionality
- Clean, maintainable code following project patterns

## Best Practices

1. **Always maintain user control** while providing intelligent assistance
2. **Require explicit approval** before implementing changes
3. **Provide clear progress reporting** throughout development cycles
4. **Focus on MVP-first development** to accelerate time to market
5. **Implement comprehensive error recovery** to prevent development dead ends
6. **Maintain high quality standards** through automated testing and validation
7. **Use learning patterns** to continuously improve AI assistance
8. **Balance automation with quality control** for sustainable development velocity

## Troubleshooting

**Common Issues:**
- Configuration files missing or corrupted
- Linear API connectivity problems
- Test coverage below thresholds
- Error recovery failures

**Solutions:**
- Use auto-setup commands to recreate configuration
- Check API credentials and network connectivity
- Review test generation and coverage requirements
- Escalate to human oversight when needed

This comprehensive system enables solo developers to achieve **5x revenue efficiency** while maintaining production-quality code through systematic AI assistance and human oversight.
