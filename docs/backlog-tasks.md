# Flow Stage - Backlog Tasks

## Security Enhancements

### CSRF Protection Implementation
**Priority**: Medium  
**Estimated Effort**: 4-6 hours  
**Status**: Backlog

**Description**: Implement Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection for authentication forms to prevent malicious websites from performing unauthorized actions on behalf of authenticated users.

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Generate CSRF tokens on form load
- [ ] Validate CSRF tokens on form submission
- [ ] Add CSRF token to sign-in form
- [ ] Add CSRF token to sign-up form
- [ ] Add CSRF token to password reset form
- [ ] Implement token rotation mechanism
- [ ] Add error handling for invalid tokens

**Technical Details**:
- Use Next.js built-in CSRF protection or implement custom solution
- Store tokens in secure HTTP-only cookies
- Validate tokens server-side before processing requests
- Consider using `@next-auth/csrf` package for integration

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- All authentication forms include CSRF tokens
- Invalid tokens are rejected with appropriate error messages
- Tokens are rotated on each request
- No impact on user experience

### Client-Side Rate Limiting
**Priority**: Low  
**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 hours  
**Status**: Backlog

**Description**: Implement client-side rate limiting to prevent rapid form submissions and protect against brute force attacks, complementing the existing server-side rate limiting in Supabase.

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Add rate limiting to sign-in form
- [ ] Add rate limiting to sign-up form
- [ ] Add rate limiting to password reset form
- [ ] Implement exponential backoff for failed attempts
- [ ] Add visual feedback for rate limiting
- [ ] Store rate limit state in localStorage/sessionStorage
- [ ] Add configuration for rate limit thresholds

**Technical Details**:
- Use debouncing for form submissions
- Implement attempt counters with timestamps
- Show user-friendly messages when rate limited
- Consider using libraries like `p-limit` or custom implementation

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Forms cannot be submitted more than X times per minute
- Users receive clear feedback when rate limited
- Rate limits reset after appropriate time periods
- No impact on legitimate user behavior

## Notes
- These tasks are deferred from the initial security audit
- Both tasks should be implemented after core functionality is stable
- Consider user experience impact when implementing security measures
- Test thoroughly in development environment before production deployment
